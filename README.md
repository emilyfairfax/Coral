# Coral
MATLAB codes for coral growth

Here are all the coral codes and function I used. The coralframework is the most basic code, and coralframeworkwith functions is just a variation on the original framework code with functions incorporated. All other files are attempts at expanding the code to incorporate shading/uplift/etc.
